* Prompt for Custom Title and Path in org-capture That Depend on Each Other

We start by defining two helper functions. Prompt for a heading title, that also will be used in the filename. Save the
title in ~org-capture-plist~ to use it with the path function.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my/org-capture-title ()
  (let ((name (read-string "Name: ")))
    (org-capture-put :title name)
    (format "* %s \n" name))
  )
#+END_SRC

Prompt for a subfolder name, change spaces to hyphens, transform the resulting pathname to lowercase.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my/org-capture-path (path)
  (let ((folder (read-string "Folder: ")))
    (expand-file-name
     (format "%s/%s.org" folder
	     (downcase (replace-regexp-in-string
			" " "-"
			(plist-get org-capture-plist :title))))
     path))
  )
#+END_SRC

Define the template in the ~init.el~ file: 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(
	("t" "TIL" entry
	 (file (my/org-capture-path "~/Google Drive/org/til"))
	 (function my/org-capture-title))
	)
      )
#+END_SRC
