* Manipulating File Contents in Temporary Buffers

It is easier to read the contents of a file and manipulate them in a /temporary buffer/ than using string data type. For
this use functions ~with-temp-buffer~ and ~insert-file-contents~.

For example reading the file contents and return a list of lines is simply

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun read-lines (path)
  "Read the file and return the list of lines"
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents path)
    (split-string (buffer-string) "/n" t)))
#+END_SRC
