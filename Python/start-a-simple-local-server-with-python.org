* Start a Simple Local Server with Python

Navigate to the folder in which we want to run the server.

Start a webserver with ~SimpleHTTPServer~.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python -m SimpleHTTPSever
#+END_SRC

The server will run at ~localhost~ on port 8000. To access it type ~http://localhost:8000/~ into the addressbar.
