* Publish project on Github Pages

Let's suppose we have already written the code and pushed it to a Github repo. The only thing to do in this case to
create and checkout a new branch called ~gh-pages~ and push it to the repo.

1) Navigate to the project folder

2) Create and checkout the branch:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout -b gh-pages
#+END_SRC

2) Push the new branch to github

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git push origin gh-pages
#+END_SRC

There should be an =index.html= in the repo so that Github Pages work properly.
